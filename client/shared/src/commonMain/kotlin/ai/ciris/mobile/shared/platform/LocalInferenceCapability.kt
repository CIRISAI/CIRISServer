 * Probe the current device and report whether it can run local inference.

 * This is intentionally pure UI-side: the wizard uses it to decide

 * is owned by the Python `mobile_local_llm` adapter, which runs its own
 * capability probe and owns the subprocess lifecycle.
 *
 * Platform expectations:
 *
 * - Android: read RAM via `ActivityManager`, verify ABI is `arm64-v8a`,
 *   apply the same 6 GB / 8 GB thresholds the Python probe uses.
 * - iOS: read RAM via `NSProcessInfo.processInfo.physicalMemory`, verify
 *   arm64, return `IOS_STUB` because no LiteRT-LM iOS model is shipped
 *   yet (the user will need to install one before `isReady` flips true).
 * - Desktop: always return `INCAPABLE` — desktop dev opt-in is handled
 *   via the Python config flag, not the wizard.
