/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE SEAM.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Every piece of wire-format knowledge about the budget-envelope contract
 * (#938 / #939) lives in this object and nowhere else: the reserved metadata
 * key names, the grant endpoint path, the request body shape, the response
 * shape, and the HTTP status → error mapping. If the backend contract moves,
 * this is the one file that changes.
 *
 * ── Contract, as confirmed with the backend author (branch
 *    `feat/938-create-ticket`, `FSD/BUDGET_ENVELOPE.md`) ────────────────────
 *
 * **The approval object is a TICKET, not a deferral.** Nothing budget-related
 * rides `POST /v1/wa/deferrals/{id}/resolve` — that endpoint completes the
 * originating task and spawns a new one, so it cannot carry a grant that must
 * outlive a single task; and its `signature` field is a formatted string that
 * is never verified, which makes it unfit to carry money authorization.
 *
 * **Request.** The agent calls the `create_ticket` tool, producing a ticket
 * with `status == "blocked"` plus reserved metadata keys. The persist
 * ticket-status enum is closed (`pending|assigned|in_progress|blocked|
 * deferred|completed|cancelled|failed`) — there is no `proposed` variant, so
 * proposals ride `blocked`. A ticket is an unapproved proposal iff
 * `status == "blocked"` AND [KEY_PROPOSAL] is present. [KEY_REQUESTED_BUDGET]
 * is optional: a proposal may ask for no money at all.
 *
 * **Issuance.** `POST /v1/tickets/{ticket_id}/budget/grant`, requiring the
 * AUTHORITY role (level 3 — ADMIN at level 2 is NOT sufficient).
 *
 * **Promotion is a separate decision.** Granting a budget does not start the
 * work; the ticket stays `blocked` until a human also PATCHes it to `pending`.
 * The UI keeps those two actions visibly distinct because approving money and
 * starting work are genuinely different decisions.
 *
 * **The agent cannot approve its own proposal.** The agent-side `update_ticket`
 * tool refuses to move a ticket out of proposal state (except to `cancelled`,
 * i.e. withdrawing it) and refuses to write any of the four reserved metadata
 * keys. The human really is the only issuer.
 *
 * **Budget state, in one read.** `GET /v1/tickets/{ticket_id}/budget` (OBSERVER)
 * returns request, grant, spend ledger and remaining trust headroom together.
 * The headroom is resolved through the wallet tool service's own
 * `_resolve_trust_envelope` — the same code path the spend gate runs — so the
 * number shown to an operator cannot drift from the number enforced when money
 * actually moves. It is null when no wallet adapter is loaded, and the UI then
 * renders nothing rather than inventing a figure.
 *
 * ── One asymmetry worth knowing ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The server enforces `granted ≤ trust ceiling`. It does **not** enforce
 * `granted ≤ requested` — an AUTHORITY user is permitted to grant more than the
 * agent asked for, e.g. when the agent lowballed. [validateGrant] refuses that
 * anyway, which makes this client deliberately **stricter than the server**.
 * That is a product policy choice, not a security boundary; see the note on
 * [validateGrant].
