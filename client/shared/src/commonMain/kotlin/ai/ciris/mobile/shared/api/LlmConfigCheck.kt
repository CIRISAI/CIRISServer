/**
 * ONE way to ask "is this LLM configuration actually going to work?".
 *
 * CIRISAgent#1062 and its follow-ups. Two screens configure an LLM provider —
 * the setup wizard and LLM settings — and they did NOT do the same thing. The
 * wizard called `validateLlmConfiguration` (does the key authenticate?) and then
 * `listModels`. Settings called only `listModels`. So a user could open Settings,
 * look at a provider whose key had been revoked, see a model dropdown, and get no
 * indication whatsoever that nothing there would work.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. A user ran for days against a Groq key returning
 * `401 Invalid API Key`, with both his providers additionally pointed at models
 * Groq does not serve (`gpt-4o-mini` and the literal string `default`). Three
 * independent things were wrong and no screen showed the state of any of them.
 *
 * So the check reports those three facts SEPARATELY, because they fail
 * separately and they need different fixes:
 *
 *   key    — does the credential authenticate at all?      -> rotate it
 *   models — did the provider give us a LIVE list?          -> connectivity/permissions
 *   model  — is the SELECTED model in that live list?       -> pick another one
 *
 * A single "valid / invalid" verdict cannot express "your key is fine but that
 * model does not exist there", which is exactly one of the two failures above.
