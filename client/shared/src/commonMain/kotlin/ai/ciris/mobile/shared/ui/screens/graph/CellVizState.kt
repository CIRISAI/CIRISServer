 *
 * Source of truth is the CIRISLens capacity scoring for the current agent
 * template, fetched via `/v1/my-data/capacity`. All five factor fields are
 * in `[0, 1]`; neutral = 1.0. When no data has arrived yet, callers should
 * pass [DEFAULT] so the cell renders "as if nothing is wrong."

 * Why a pure data class + helpers: keeps visual-dial math testable from
 * `commonTest` without pulling in Compose. The Compose layer just reads
 * the derived dials and applies them.

 *
 * Inputs:
 *  - `serviceHealthFrac` in `[0, 1]` — fraction of core services healthy
 *    from `/v1/system/health` (proxies for k_eff).
 *  - `llmHealthFrac` in `[0, 1]` — fraction of LLM providers healthy with
 *    closed circuit breakers (proxies for σ, sustainability).
 *
 * Returns null when neither signal has arrived yet (so the badge renders
 * fleet-only rather than a spurious 0).
