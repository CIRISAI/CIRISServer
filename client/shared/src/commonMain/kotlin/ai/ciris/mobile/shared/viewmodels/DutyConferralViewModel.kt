/**
 * Drives the **Delegate moderation duty** card — conferring `slash` / `moderate` /
 * `review` on another self, with an explicit answer to "may they pass it on, and
 * how far?".
 *
 * Two loopback + owner-gated routes, the accord co-scrub shape:
 *  - [propose] mints the FIRST scrub. The returned `partial` does NOT yet confer
 *    the duty (it is 1 of `quorum_needed`).
 *  - [cosign] appends THIS holder's scrub to that partial. When
 *    [scrubCount] meets [quorumNeeded] the node flips [adopted] and the duty is
 *    conferred.
 *
 * The `partial` is OPAQUE: it is held as a raw [JsonElement] and handed back to
 * the node byte-for-byte, because the envelope's signature covers its exact
 * bytes. The app never re-encodes it and never reads its internals.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE: the app holds NO keys and performs NO crypto. It supplies the
 * holder's key_id + ML-DSA USB path; the LOCAL node opens the hardware and signs
 * (the YubiKey touch is the consent).
