"""Guard the vendored CIRIS client localization bundles (CIRISServer copy).

The client UI strings live in FOUR committed runtime bundles that MUST stay
byte-identical — one per platform loader (any that goes stale ships raw keys at
runtime):

  - client/shared/src/desktopMain/resources/localization/*.json   (CANONICAL)
  - client/desktopApp/src/main/resources/localization/*.json      (desktop pkg)
  - client/androidApp/src/main/assets/localization/*.json         (Android)
  - client/iosApp/iosApp/localization/*.json                      (iOS)

``en.json`` is the source of truth. The supported-language list is read from the
bundle ``manifest.json`` (never hardcoded).

WHY THIS FILE READS THE WAY IT DOES (CIRISServer#366)
-----------------------------------------------------
The previous revision printed ``OK: all locales at key parity`` over a bundle in
which 53 server-message ids were **dead in every language, including English** —
because it compared FLATTENED key sets, and flattening maps both the nested form
``{"admin": {"ttl": {"expired": …}}}`` and the flat form
``{"admin.ttl.expired": …}`` onto the same dotted string. To a key-set
comparison a flat key and a nested key are the same key. They are not the same
at runtime: ``LocalizationManager.resolveKey`` ALWAYS splits on ``.`` and walks
nested objects, and never tries an exact top-level match, so a flat dotted key
resolves to null — and the English fallback failed identically, because en.json
carried the same flat shape. The strings were present, byte-identical across all
four bundles, and completely dead. The instrument could not see the defect it
was pointed at. (Data fixed in 26605b5; this guard is why it cannot recur.)

So every check here is written against the RUNTIME semantics, not against a
convenient normal form, and every check reports the size of what it examined —
a zero finding is only evidence when the denominator is non-zero. A check whose
denominator is zero is itself an error.

The checks, two severities:

  ERROR (exit 1 — blocks CI):
    json-validity      every *.json in all four bundles parses.
    bundle-mirror      the four bundles carry identical file sets and every
                       file is byte-identical to canonical.
    manifest-coverage  every manifest language has a file, and every locale
                       file is listed in the manifest.
    reference-coverage every literal key passed to localizedString("…") /
                       getString("…") in commonMain Kotlin RESOLVES in en.json
                       under resolveKey semantics (undefined -> renders raw).
    key-resolvability  every leaf address in every locale file is reachable by
                       a faithful port of resolveKey — i.e. no flat dotted keys,
                       in any language. This is the #366 check.
    placeholder-parity a translated value carries exactly the placeholders of
                       its en.json source ({named}, ${…}, {0}, %s, %1$s).
                       Corruption, not lag: "{cont}" renders literally.

  WARNING (exit 0 by default; exit 1 under --strict):
    translation-drift  a locale missing en.json keys, or carrying empty values,
                       or carrying keys en.json does not have. Missing
                       translations fall back to English by design, so this
                       informs rather than blocks — it is what the ``localize-ui``
                       Claude workflow fixes.

Usage:
    python3 client/tools/check_localization_sync.py            # ERRORs block
    python3 client/tools/check_localization_sync.py --strict   # drift blocks too
    python3 client/tools/check_localization_sync.py --self-test # mutation-verify

``--self-test`` builds a synthetic bundle in a temp dir, breaks it one way at a
time, and asserts each check fires with a message naming the break. It is the
answer to "this gate has never been shown able to fail" — CI runs it before the
real check, so the gate proves it can fail on every run.

Exit codes:
    0 - no errors (and no warnings under --strict; all mutations caught under
        --self-test)
    1 - at least one error (or any warning under --strict, or an uncaught
        mutation under --self-test)

# **ENUMERATED DEBT, NOT AN EXEMPTION.**
#
# Broadening id extraction to the `format!`-texted shape (see
# `_SERVER_MSG_ID_FORMATTED`) revealed 13 ids that have NEVER had an en.json
# entry and therefore render the server's English in all 29 languages. They are
# real, they predate this checker being able to see them, and fixing them means
# writing 29 translations apiece — the `localize-ui` workflow, tracked in
# CIRISServer#484.
#
# Listing them here rather than weakening the check keeps three properties:
#   * a NEW uncovered id still fails, so the debt cannot grow;
#   * the debt is enumerated in source, so it cannot be forgotten;
#   * an id that GETS covered must be removed from this list — the check below
#     fails on a stale entry — so the list can only shrink.
#
# WHEN ADDING HERE IS LEGITIMATE, AND WHEN IT IS NOT.
#
# Legitimate: an operator-facing sentence that was previously emitted as BARE
# ENGLISH PROSE with no id at all is given one. That is strictly better for the
# reader — the client can resolve the key the moment a translation lands, where
# before there was nothing to resolve — and this list is the mechanism that
# keeps it visible until then.
#
# Not legitimate: silencing a NEW uncovered id that could simply be translated,
# or one whose only problem is that nobody has run `localize-ui`. Add the
# en.json entry and the 29 bundles instead.
#
# The three `operator.store.*_not_measured` ids below are the first kind: they
# replaced hardcoded English in the `not_measured` block of
# `src/operator_surface.rs`, on a surface that advertises `source_locale` and

    A key-set comparison cannot see this: flattening collapses
    ``{"nav": {"home": …}}`` and ``{"nav.home": …}`` onto the same address. Only
    the resolver's own walk tells them apart, and only the first one works.

    This is checked per FILE, in the file's own address space, so it fires in
    both directions — a flat key in en.json (dead for everyone, since the English
    fallback fails identically) and a flat key in one locale (dead for that
    locale's readers) are each an error against that file.
